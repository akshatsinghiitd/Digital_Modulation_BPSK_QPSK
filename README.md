# Digital Modulation Analysis using BPSK over AWGN Channel

## 📘 Project Overview
This project presents a MATLAB-based simulation and performance analysis of
**Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)** over an **Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)**
channel.

The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of **Bit Error Rate (BER)**
for different **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** values to understand the impact of
noise on digital communication systems.
