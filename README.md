# Digital Modulation Analysis using BPSK and QPSK over AWGN Channel

##  Project Overview
This project presents a MATLAB-based simulation and performance analysis of **BPSK** and **QPSK** digital modulation schemes over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel.

The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of **Bit Error Rate (BER)** for different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values.
